    <h1>Interneting is Not Easy!</h1>
    <p>Hello everyone! First, we <strong>need</strong> to learn some basic HTML. Then, we have to write about our favorite hobby or activity. I'll list my favorite hobby and activity below.</p>

    <h2>Favorite Hobby</h2>
    <p>So, my favorite <em>hobby</em> is drawing. I mainly draw simplified animals, like cats, and people. Some people comment that my drawings are "cute" or "good", but honestly I think it's not and I need to improve. Currently, I don't draw very often because I have to focus on other things that are more important like school.</p>

    <p>This is an <em>unordered</em> list of some things I draw:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Animals, mainly cats</li>
        <li>People</li>
        <li>Plants, like trees and flowers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Favorite Activity</h2>
    <p>My favorite <em>activity</em> is traveling. Yes, traveling, but I don't go often. It is fun to explore things I have never seen before. Also, learning code programs might be my new favorite thing after today's activity. It is interesting to learn about how it works. Even though we're only learning about the basics. Hopefully, it doesn't get too difficult. Before, I did take a course related to Computer Science at my school, but sadly I didn't learn much from it.</p>
    
    <p>Here is an <em>ordered</em> list of animals I like:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Cats</li>
        <li>Dogs</li>
        <li>Pandas</li>
    </ol>
    <p><em><strong>That's it for now. Bye!</strong></em></p>
    <p>Regards,<br/>This site's author</p>
