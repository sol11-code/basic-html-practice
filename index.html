    <h1>Interneting is Not Easy!</h1>
    <p>Hello everyone! First, we <strong>need</strong> to learn some basic HTML.</p>

    <h2>Favorite activity</h2>
    <p>So my favorite activity is traveling. Yes, traveling. It is fun to explore things I have never seen before. Also, learning code programs might be my new favorite thing after today's activity. It is interesting to learn about how it works. Even though we're only learning about the basics.</p>
    
    <h2>Lists</h2> 
    <p>this is an <em>unordered</em> list:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>one</li>
        <li>two</li>
        <li>three</li>
    </ul>

    <p>this is an <em>ordered</em> list:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>red</li>
        <li>yellow</li>
        <li>blue</li>
    </ol>
    <p><em><strong>That's it for now. Bye!</strong></em></p>
    <p>Regards,<br/>the author</p>
